### MGy's web site project

This is the web page of my course **Linear Algebra** at 
*Corvinus University of Budapest*.
The branch ``gh-pages``  includes the the files serving input for Jekyll. 

The page is part of my [web site](https://magyarkuti.github.io).

The latex code of the classes are in the classes folder.
To compile the files my corvinusmetropolis latex class is needed. 
See https://github.com/magyarkuti/corvinusmetropolis

The recommended command is
latexmk -lualatex <file name>
