for the Fall semester course of 2019-2020.

The [Course Syllabus](http://www.uni-corvinus.hu/magyarkuti/LinearAlgebra-2019.pdf)  contains more detailed information.
The most important part is as follows:

* The Office Hours is in S 208/b at Monday 4.30 pm. Registration via e-mail is required not later than 7 pm of the actual day before.
